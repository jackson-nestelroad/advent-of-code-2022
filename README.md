# Advent of Code 2022
This repository features solutions to the 2022 **Advent of Code** hosted on https://adventofcode.com/2022/about.

## About
For my fifth year of doing Advent of Code, I chose to implement my solutions using the **Rust** programming language. I used this language in 2021 as well, but I chose to use this language again, as I have not used it much since then and very much enjoy using it.
